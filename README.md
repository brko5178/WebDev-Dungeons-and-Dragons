# WebDev-Dungeons-and-Dragons
[This link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/c0oirqbtq4h9ev8lrk8uo/dndinceptor-demo.mov?e=2&rlkey=noaxk7cg77839luswdtrjjwas&st=836h8kss&dl=0) will navigate you to the video demonstration of a website developed by myself and four other collaborators. The goal of this website was to give [Dungeons and Dragons](https://www.dndbeyond.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqRNQIehDEPgO85YfWAs_wFa2cnmVrSJ9m1yhYBd3pcF0mEFiUM) players an easy tool to generate monster encounters for their campaign. Monsters are pulled from the dungeons and dragons database of offical monsters and are chosen based on user inputs inlcuding number of players in the party, each of their levels, and the desired difficulty. After the information is set, a monster encounter will be generated. The site also contains a page that lists all the monsters. Unfortunately, we have decided not to keep the website live and running any longer due to costs and minimal use, but I am still proud of this fun project!
